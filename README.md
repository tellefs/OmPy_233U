Oslo Method for the master thesis Project for Tellef Storebakken

The Oslo Method is here done with the newly made OmPy software.

Notebook started by following the OmPy "Getting started" guide from https://ompy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

The alfna-matrix is from 233U(alpha, gamma alpha) experiment conducted in 2012 at the Oslo Cyclotrone Laboratory and calibrated
in jan/feb/mar 2020. There might still be more changes to the alfna-matrix, as the calibration process is still ongoing.
